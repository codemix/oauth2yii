=========

An OAuth2 client / server extension for the Yii framework.


# NOTE: PARTS OF THIS EXTENSION ARE STILL INCOMPLETE!!

Missing:

 * Support for Authorization Code Grant on client / server

This extension is a wrapper around [OAuth 2.0 Server PHP](http://bshaffer.github.io/oauth2-server-php-docs/)
that makes it easy to add OAuth2 authentication to your application.

Note, that before you can start using this extension you need to understand some basics about how
OAuth2 works. So we recommend to read the [OAuth2 introduction](docs/oauth2.md) first.

 * [OAuth2 Introduction](docs/oauth2.md).
 * [Installation](docs/installation.md)
 * [How to use an OAuth2 client](docs/client.md)
 * [How to use an OAuth2 server](docs/server.md)
 * [How to use an OAuth2 client and server on the same host](docs/clientserver.md)
 * [DB Tables and custom storages](docs/storage.md)
