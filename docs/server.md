Server
======

If you want to run an OAuth2 server you have to decide which grant type(s) you
want to support. For a definition of grant types please refer to the
[OAuth2 introduction](oauth2.md). You can enable grant types in the main application component.

# Configuration

## Server Application Component

Add the application component to your `main.php` and decide, which grant types you want to enable.

```php
'components' => array(
    'oauth2' => array(
        'class'                     => 'OAuth2Yii\Component\ServerComponent',
        // Enable one or more grant types
        'enableAuthorization'       => true,
        'enableImplicit'            => true,
        'enableUserCredentials'     => true,
        'enableClientCredentials'   => true,

    ),
```

Depending on your grant types you also need to provide one or two actions:

 * Authorization code: `authorization` and `token`
 * Implicit: `authorization` and `token`
 * User credentials: `token`
 * Client credentials: `token`

## WebUser Component

In order for `Yii::app()->user->isGuest` and `Yii::app()->user->id` to work, you can configure
a custom `WebUser` component:


```php
'components' => array(
    'user' => array(
        'class' => 'OAuth2Yii\Component\WebUser',
```

If you used a different name than `oauth2` for your server component, you can configure it
in the `oauth2` property of `WebUser`.

## `token` action

This action is required by all grant types. It's available as an
[action class](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/1.1/en/basics.controller#action) that you
can configure in any controller you want. We recommend creating an `OAuthController` and
import the action as follows.

```php
<?php
class OAuthController extends CController
{
    public function actions()
    {
        return array(
            'token' => array(
                'class' => 'OAuth2Yii\Action\Token',
                // Optional: configure the name of the server component if it's not oauth2
                //'oauth2Component' => 'oauth'
            ),
        );
    }
}
```

If you use URLs in path format the URL should then be `oauth/token`. You can of course
also define a URL rule and use any URL you want. But in any case you need to tell your
clients under which URL to find your token action.


## Configuration of the `authorize` action

TODO


# Usage

## Checking permissions

The main purpose of all this is of course, to check if a client has permission to access
a resource on your server. That's very similar to how you would do permission checks
in Yii. Here's a simple example:

```php
public function actionView()
{
    if(!Yii::app()->oauth2->checkAccess()) {
        throw new CHttpException(403, 'Forbidden');
    }

    // Your protected code ...
}
```

The client requesting this action will only be allowed if he passes an *access token* along
in the request header, that he obtained through one of the above grant types. The access
token must also not be expired or the permission check will fail.

If you need a more fine grained control over which clients are allowed which actions,
you can use scopes. In this case the above permission check would look like:

```php
Yii::app()->oauth2->checkAccess('photos');
```

But in order to use scopes you must list all available scopes in your OAuth2 server component
in `main.php`.

```php
'components' => array(
    'oauth2' => array(
        ...
        'scopes' => array(
            'wall',
            'profile',
            'friends',
            'photos',
        ),
        'defaultScope' => 'profile',
    ),
```

On the authorize action, you can let your users select, which of the configured scopes
they want to grant access to the client. This selection will be stored together with the
access token for this client. Whenever that client tries to access the above action it
has to send the right scope and will only be permitted if the user granted permission.

## Fetching the user id

If a request with a valid access token comes in, you can also retrieve the user id that
this access token was stored for (unless you use grant type client credentials).

```php
$id = Yii::app()->oauth2->userId;
```
